      h1 About
      p Current Austin resident, I've had had an interest in technology and web development since an early age. Since the time of Yahoo Geocities and America Online I have wanted to build my own niche on the internet.
      p I graduated in 2012 with a Bachelors of Science degree in Information Technology from Florida State University and specialized in web development, database, and programming courses. During my time time at FSU I picked up various internships to continue to learn about web development and see what a career in the tech field is like.
      p Needless to say I was smitten. Between my course work and internships, I decided to set my career sites on web developer. After graduating I was hired as a Junior PHP developer for Zimmerman Advertising where I cut my teeth professionally building websites for clients like Party City and WhiteCastle for a year.
      p I currently live in Austin, Texas and work as a Front End Developer for IBM's Cloud Division working extensively with Node.js, React.js, and Python.
