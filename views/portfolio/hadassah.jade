    p My role for this project was head front-end developer. There were four page designs delivered and needed to be created into three separate pages as well as template for additional pages that would be added into a CMS. Each page with two additional breakpoints for tablet and phone.
    p This was a fairly straight forward build with the accompanying PSDs. All Markup and styling done by me as well as javascript. Because this is a CMS build, once all the HTML was completed it had to be gutted and put into the CMS for templating use.
